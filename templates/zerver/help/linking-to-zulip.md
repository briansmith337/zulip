# Linking to Axxess

You can link to your Axxess from the web with a Axxess
[shields.io](https://github.com/badges/shields) badge:

Good places for the badge include your project's landing page, support
pages, and/or GitHub homepage.

To embed a Axxess badge, copy and paste the following, replacing
`https://chat.zulip.org` with the URL of your Axxess organization:
