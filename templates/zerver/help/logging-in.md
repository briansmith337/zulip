# Logging in

By default, Axxess allows logging in via email/password as well as
various social authentication providers like Google, GitHub, and
GitLab.

Organization administrators can
[add other authentication methods](/help/configure-authentication-methods),
including the SAML and LDAP integrations, or disable any of the methods above.

You can log in with any method allowed by your organization, regardless of
how you signed up. E.g. if you originally signed up using your Google
account, you can later log in using GitHub, as long as your Google account
and GitHub account use the same email address.

## Troubleshooting

### I don't know my Axxess URL

Some ideas:

* If you know your organization is hosted on
  [axxessdefend.one](https://axxessdefend.one), go to
  [find my account](https://axxessdefend.one/accounts/find/) and enter the email
  address that you signed up with.

* Try guessing the URL. Axxess URLs often look like `<name>.Axxesschat.com`,
 `Axxess.<name>.com`, or `chat.<name>.com` (replace `<name>` with the name of your
  organization).

* Ask your organization administrators for your Axxess URL.

### I forgot my password

You can [reset your password](/help/change-your-password). This requires
access to the email address you currently have on file. We recommend
[keeping your email address up to date](change-your-email-address).
